## Kanstantsin Chaiko

I am result orientated and highly motivated person with more then 11 years experience in mobile development. I have a solid knowledge in Android development and also have a huge experience in Kotlin, Java and Swift. I have a basic knowledge in iOS development. Familiar with android architecture principles: MVVM, MVP, MVI; with google clean architecture components: ViewModel, LiveData, RoomORM. Also have hands on experience with Realm database and huge experience with Firebase solutions(realtime database, firestore, storage). I have written variety of managers for Firebase and as result we had an incapsulated solution, covered with unit tests. I have a practical experience in Reactive approaches to development: RxJava, RxAndroid, RxKotlin, RxSwift. I have a solid knowledge in android lifecycle and even have written own architecture for big and complex screens, this approach can help us to decompose monster screens with a lot of UI logic to some compact component with incapsulated logic. Also have big practical experience with writing different variety of custom views(view groups and views), and reach huge profit from code re-using. I have a strong experience with client-server libraries: Retrofit, OkHttp and also I've written my http client, and have experience with network socket technologies. I have a deep diving knowledge about Retrofit e.g. writing custom adapters, custom parsers, big variety of different interceptors(e.g. login interceptor, network status interceptor and e.t.c.), also work with coroutines adapter and Kotlin coroutines, RxAdapters for retrofit. I always use dependency injection framework(Dagger2) or service locator(Koin) in my projects, and initialize objects easily. Also have a good experience in writing tests: unit tests with Junit framework and ui tests for android with Espresso library and Robolectric framework. I have hands on experience with security level of the application (signing, obfuscating code, database enctryption, handshake certificates and SSL connection). Also have practical experience with Kotlin Coroutines and Compose, all new stuff is written by me by those technologies.

Now I'm working in big, multicultural development team(10-13 developers splitted in two sub-teams), where I have responsibilities such as development, code review. There is a good test coverage in the product. Also have experience with continious integration(for example Gitlab CI pipelines). Familiar with various linting tools, also sonar qube. Familiar with all steps for releasing of applications and continiously supporting feature development. 

Also I've participated in a cross-team sub-project development and represented Android mobile team in that round.

I have a good feedback from team members, managers. Also I can be responsible for product goals and solutions, can make an explanation about any technical decisions. I am really excited when I learn something new in mobile development. Also ready to participate in mentoring programs, and sharing knowledge programs. Participate in various conferences, such as DroidCon(Berlin, Turin), also actively join Munich meetups such as KotlinConf and GDG meetups.
