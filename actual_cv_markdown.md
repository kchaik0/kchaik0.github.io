## Kanstantsin Chaiko

I am highly motivated person with 7,5 years' experience in mobile
development. I have a solid knowledge in Android development. I have a huge experience in Kotlin, Java and Swift. Familiar with android
architecture principles: MVVM, MVP; with google clean architecture
components: ViewModel, LiveData, RoomORM. I have a basic knowledge in
iOS development. Practical experience in Reactive approaches to
development: RxJava, RxAndroid, RxKotlin, RxSwift. I have a solid
knowledge in android lifecycle. I have a strong experience with request
clients(libraries): Retrofit, Volley and my own http client. For
retrofit I have a deep diving knowledge e.g. writing custom adapters,
custom parsers, also work with coroutines adapter and Kotlin coroutines,
RxAdapters for retrofit. Also have a good experience in writing tests:
unit tests with Junit framework and ui tests for android with Espresso
library and Robolectric. I have a good experience with security level of
the application (signing, obfuscate code, SSL connection).

Now I am working as a team lead in mobile team in our group. I control
